# Xodia
Xodia is a creative programming challenge where  two programs play against each other on a pre-programmed platform.
The platform for this game is a modified sudoku grid, which the bots will capture to score maximum points.
This repo contains a two sample bot files in c and c++, the platform file and the shell script that uses the bots filenames as arguments to call the platform i.e grid.txt.
